This is an HTML/CSS website built to show MEDP 150 class content. 

Over the last three decades, dramatic changes in media technology
have resulted in a fundamental reconsideration of the once strict borders between print,
design, architecture, computational and other media arts. In today's world, being a medialiterate citizen requires understanding and being able to communicate using computer
graphics and digital media. MEDP/FILMP 150, one part of a 2-semester sequence,
introduces students to the practical fundamentals of visual communication, design, digital
graphics and illustration, web design, networks, digital photography, and new media art
in a lecture/lab format. It is a foundations course in 2D design and computer media
presented in the integrated fashion that today's media practitioners work in.
