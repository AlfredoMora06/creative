                    Caroline Busta just like Kyle Chayka gives us compelling points about how we live our life and what
                    we consider counter culture nowadays. Busta, using complex language, criticizes the hierarchical
                    structure social media and corporations has established over time. Digital platforms have
                    transformed counter cultural activity into profitable, high-engagement content, being counter
                    cultural no longer means being counter-hegemonic or counter corporations. However, unlike Chyaka,
                    Busta offers possible solutions, where Chyaka sees a problem in minimalism, Busta sees true power.
                    Busta explains how the power of today is firmly situated in minimalism, restraint, and ease. She
                    states how actual power is controlling the means by which lesser power can be displayed. Even though
                    you may have 20,000 followers on Instagram, Zuckerbug is still the owner of your online profile, you
                    have limited power. Actual power keeps a low profile and doesn’t need a social media presence.

                    As I stated earlier, in Chayka’s response to nothingness, she catalogs it as something we are
                    prisoner’s to, and becoming more attracted to, something negative. Busta, however, sees it as a
                    possible solution, true counter culture is hidden in the nothingness. I agree with the author's
                    assessment of where counterculture resides. Personally, I have explored the dark forests of Reddit
                    and it’s autonomy. As Busta describes true counter culture is not interested in being seen—at least
                    not in person. It gets no thrill out of wearing leather and a mohawk & walking past main-street
                    shops. But it does demonstrate a hunger for freedom—freedom from the attention economy, from
                    atomization, and the extractive logic of mainstream communication. We can imagine a proliferation of
                    digital gangs in dark forests who hold secrets dear, and a new desire for scarcity in cultural
                    objects—deeper and closer connections made between people even while rejecting the platform’s
                    compulsion to “like and share.” In the internet era.
