		<p>Alfredo Morales is an aspiring software engineer and computer science student at Hunter College. </p>

		<p>He is of Hispanic descent and as a teenager lived 5 years in Oaxaca, Mexico. However, growing up
			in Brooklyn, New York he realized that as time goes on, generations stay at home, even avoiding
			their next door neighbor. Even a person's motherland is strange to them nowadays. Even though we
			are more connected than ever, we live contained in a bubble. It is more than evident that due to
			the current pandemic, communities are less likely to interact, however, by taking a look into
			how New Yorkers interact with the burst of technology in modern life, we can begin to see
			patterns. </p>

		<blockquote class="rte">AN UNEXPLORED LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING.</blockquote>

		<p>Alfredo is a true believer that an unexplored life is not worth living and has subscribed to the idea that
			creating art is a very noble way to pursue that purpose.</p>
