					<p>Alfredo Morales is an aspiring software engineer and computer science student at Hunter
						College.
					</p>

					<p>He is of Hispanic descent and as a teenager lived 5 years in Oaxaca, Mexico. However, growing
						up
						in Brooklyn, New York he realized that as time goes on, generations stay at home, even
						avoiding
						their next door neighbor. Even a person's motherland is strange to them nowadays. Even
						though we
						are more connected than ever, we live contained in a bubble. It is more than evident that
						due to
						the current pandemic, communities are less likely to interact, however, by taking a look
						into
						how New Yorkers interact with the burst of technology in modern life, we can begin to see
						patterns.
					</p>

					<p>His work explores the lack or abundance of communities in our lives by observing everyday life
						and
						by containing it in photos for everyone to observe and draw their own conclusions.</p>

					<blockquote class="rte">AN UNEXPLORED LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING.</blockquote>

					<p>Alfredo is a true believer that an unexplored life is not worth living and has subscribed to
						the
						idea that creating art is a very noble way to pursue that purpose.</p>
