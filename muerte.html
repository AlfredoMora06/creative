                <p class="response text-justify">Ernest Becker affirms that the human is the only being alive that is
                    conscious of his own death. The only one who has the ability to imagine a world without him present,
                    and that this realization has the potential to turn him into a neurotic if he does not solve it.

                <p>
                    Maybe we should choose to live in the present and explore as many roads as possible with the time we
                    have, as we well know... an unexplored life does not deserve to be lived. And perhaps eternity is
                    not an infinite duration of time but rather it's timelessness.

                    This image was taken on Friday, February 19, 2021. I chose this image in particular because I was
                    carrying the skull made in my hometown and thought it could fit with this passage. I changed the
                    contrast and exposure on this image to give a pale look to the hand as it would correspond more to
                    the theme. I also used a shallow depth of field to give focus on the hand and skull.
