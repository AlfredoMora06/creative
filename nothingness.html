                <p class="response text-justify">Kyle Chayka gives us a compelling read,
                    making us question this new
                    normal life we
                    are currently
                    living that
                    would’ve been deemed abnormal a year or two ago. Nowadays, news outlets and social media focus on
                    constantly
                    giving us headlines, quotes and information of all kinds. We try to find escape from this noise and
                    static that
                    is always wanting our attention, some of us by unplugging, others by escaping physically. As
                    Chaykaetz
                    goes on, I
                    recall a content creator known as Matt D’ Avela and how he has grown his YouTube channel to over
                    three million
                    subscribers through minimalism (the idea of living with less). At first I see nothing wrong with
                    this lifestyle
                    of having less materialistic possessions and living through experiences. Although, as Chaykaetz
                    argues,
                    “This
                    obsession with absence, the intentional erasure of self and surroundings, is the apotheosis of what
                    I’ve come to
                    think of as a culture of negation: a body of cultural output, from material goods to entertainment
                    franchises to
                    lifestyle fads, that evinces a desire to reject the overstimulation that defines contemporary
                    existence.”
                </p>

                <p class="response text-justify">
                    Chaykaetz doesn’t give us a solution as there probably isn’t one, he provides a Nietzsche-type
                    perspective on
                    us. He states a problem, that the search for nothingness has led us nowhere, and in fact, has only
                    imprisoned us
                    more in this bubble that we might call home at times - stuck with our amazon wishlist, netflix binge
                    list,
                    seamless seemingly limitless pizza orders and video games. However, there are different perspectives
                    in the way
                    we can look at things. Maybe nothingness might not be entirely bad, nothing is absolute in the world
                    when it
                    comes to complicated concepts. Chaykaetz swims into shallow waters with the concept of companies and
                    how
                    they use
                    information for profit. This is where the idea of Big Data comes in. Big Data is known as the
                    ability of society
                    to harness information in novel ways to produce useful insights or goods and services of significant
                    value. Data
                    today is no longer regarded as static or stale, whose usefulness was finished once the purpose for
                    which it was
                    collected was achieved. Data has become a raw material of business, a vital economic input, used to
                    create a new
                    form of economic value.

                <p class="response text-justify">
                    As our digital universe only expands with time, to unimaginable amounts. Big Data is used by
                    companies to gain
                    more wealth and power at the expense of its users. This leads to an issue in privacy. GPS technology
                    and
                    smartphone apps take note of what we buy, where and when, how much money we have in the bank, whom
                    we
                    text/e-mail, what we visit, how and where we travel, what time we go to sleep and wake up, etc.
                    Maybe the act of
                    nothingness, total unplugging should be seen as an act of rebellion, counter-culture, a movement to
                    take control
                    of our life again. If that’s the case we should definitely strive to be consistent in what we aren’t
                    using, not
                    just social media, and not to escape life but go back to enjoying it.
