                <p class="response text-justify">For this assignment I decided to go for a simple feel. I definitely had
                    inspiration from lecture on the Trechet Tiles. However, although the black and white definitely has
                    something going for it in terms of aesthetic and fanciness, I knew I wanted to add more color even
                    if it is not something you would usually think of when you think of these colored designs. I wanted
                    to give it a very child-like design and pick fun colors. The triadic color scheme from the Adobe
                    color wheel gave me a brighter color that I wanted to use on the squares. I was decided on using
                    darker colors for the main squares and a lighter color with white to have a broader range. This
                    pattern would most likely be used on gift wrapping or even as hypnotic art. If you squint your eyes
                    as you look the pattern, you can see the squares change in sizes. Pretty eerie.

                <p class="response text-justify">For the second pattern, I wanted to go for a chill-y mood. Imagining a
                    dice, I decided to draw one up from a hexagon, using the line tools I was able to give it a cube
                    look and make it 3-d-ish. The first colors that comes to mind when I think of chill are the colors
                    blue, black and white. Therefore, I decided to experiment with the colors on the dice, keeping the
                    dots and borders black for noticeability and adding more border width on the borders to give a
                    cartoonish feel. I also decided to make the background a lighter blue to not stay in plain white.
                    For it to stand out in its own way I decided to use a darker blue for the dice. Even though this was
                    a beginner trying out new styles I believe this pattern would definitely be out there for some
                    wrapping paper for a kid's birthday or maybe a simple background screen saver, one of those that
                    come as a default.</p>
